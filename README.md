# news-scraper-mongodb-js

## GWU Full Stack Web program - homework 15 - Node JS, Express, MongoDB 

### deployed at berlin-news-scraper.herokuapp.com

  Use node &amp; mongodb with several js npm packages to scrape news 
  article data from the Berliner Morgenpost.
  
  These npm packages are used: 
  express, express-handlebars, mongoose, body-parser, cheerio, request
  
  The app scrapes news article information - title, link, and summary - 
  from the newspaper website.  It allows the user to add notes by clicking 
  on an article, these are also stored in a mongodb collection.  The user 
  can click the link and go to the article.
  
  Some problems with this implementation due to time constraints, to be 
  addressed in the near future.
